Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

This is my repository to share with the community, students, udacity's instructors and anyone who's interested in data science.
All my course works will be commited in this repository. Fell free to contact me to share, discuss and whatever.

This repository will be organized by the udacity's projects, through P0 to P7. The directories, for each project, has the following structure:
  /readme.md - brief description of the project and key infos
  /documentation/ - all the info used to develop the project
  /results/ - the output of the hard work
